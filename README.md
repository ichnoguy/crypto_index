# Heyrhett Crypto Index

## What is this?

Heyrhett is going to publicly trade an imaginary portfolio meant for crypto.

## What is the Point?

People often ask me which crypto I like or own.  Crypto is extremely volatile however.  Something I like one day might change the next.  Hacks or flaws in code are often found, which can make a big impact on an underlying community and technology.

People can watch this repository to see how I would trade an imaginary crypto portfolio.

## This is Not Financial Advice

Please see the associated file for a more elaborate description.  I don't claim that anything I trade will get a good return.  It could all go to zero.  I honestly don't know.  Following this index could make you lose all your money.

## Anchored to Bitcoin

After every trade, the latest Git commit hash will be anchored to Bitcoin using Tierion.  This ensures that every commit is timestamped by Bitcoin and could not have been created at a later time.  The timestamping precision is limited by how often Bitcoin blocks are produced, and how often Tierion submits a transaction.  The service generally submits many transactions every day.

## Digitally Signed

Every trade will be digitally signed with my private key.  This ensures that 2 different repositories signed by my key would expose an "Innumeracy" stock picking scam described here: https://ask.metafilter.com/216295/Is-this-famous-investment-scam-real-or-fiction
