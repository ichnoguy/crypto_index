# This is Not Financial Advice

## I am Not A Financial Advisor

This is important because no one should think that this index was created in order to look out for someone else's financial best interests.

When you hire a real financial advisor (not me), the first thing you want to ask is if they are a "fiduciary".  This means that they are legally obligated to look out for your financial best interest.  I am NOT a fiduciary.

## Disclosure of Holdings

I may or may not hold some of the assets described in the index in real life.  As the index will change over time, the amounts will depend at that particular time.

## Risks

Cryptocurrency is extremely volatile. Bitcoin has crashed more than 90% in price in the past.  Other crypto tokens have crashed more.  It is possible and likely to lose a lot of money trading crypto currency.
## What is the Point of this Then?

This is simply a public record of Heyrhett's pretend trading in an imaginary crypto portfolio.

A record will be kept through Github and and each trade will be anchored in a Tierion Chainpoint using Bitcoin.
